# OpenCVSentrygun
A Nerf sentry gun with machine vision based on Open CV.

A Servo controls the pitch and pan. Machine vision achieved with Raspberry Pi 3b and Pi camera module. The firing mechanism consists of two dc spinner motors for propulsion and a servo "firing pin".

# BOM

Pan Stepper: 1x M94SP-2K

Pitch Servo: 1x MG995

Firing servo: 1x MG90S

DC motors: 2x RF-300CA

Computer: Raspi 3b

Camera: Raspi Cam module 5mp

All frame material is made from miscellaneous scrap

# Code

I have split the code into several modules to make it easier to debug. I self-taught most of the Raspi code from several sources (sources) and have use some of their techniques in my code. I have also included optional code bits that I used for testing throughout the process.
CAD Models

I modeled all the frame components in Solidworks before fabricating. Almost the entire frame is made from miscellaneous scrap.
